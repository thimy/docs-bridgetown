We now identify deprecated elements in both OpenApi and AsyncApi specifications, and highlight them in your documentations.

We wanted to release it fast, as it was an important missing feature, but this is just the beginning: we have a lot of ideas on how we can enhance deprecation support that we will implement in the upcoming weeks.

Want to share some use cases with us? [Pick a slot on Anthony's calendar](https://calendly.com/bump-anthony/30-min-meeting), he will be super glad to hear from you.
