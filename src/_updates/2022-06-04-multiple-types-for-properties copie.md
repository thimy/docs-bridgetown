title: Multiple types for properties
tags: [Improvement]
---

Here is an update that was released some time ago but out of the radar: we now display all available types (even `nullable`) on any properties in your OpenAPI or AsyncAPI definition. 

Youâ€™ll now see these correctly displayed properties in your documentation. Multiple types may look like a slight improvement but will add clarification to your team and community.

And we have an example to show how great it is (thanks to [Meilisearch's documentation](https://bump.sh/doc/meilisearch#operation-indexes-documents-search-body-filter)).
