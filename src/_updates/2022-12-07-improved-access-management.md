Access management has been reshaped, thanks to extended tests and user feedback.

Inviting external customers and partners to access internal APIs is now possible directly from the dashboard.

From the dedicated section in your hub/documentation settings, you can quickly modify who has access to what. Open it to teammates of your organization, or invite external partners by email directly.

Password-protected level will stay available for a limited amount of time. More info can be found in our [help center](https://docs.bump.sh/help/access-management/).
