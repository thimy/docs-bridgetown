They have many names: schema alternatives, discriminator, inheritance... but you probably know them as oneOf, anyOf and allOf.

Bump now fully supports polymorphism for AsyncAPI and OpenAPI. You can already upload your latest API specification file to check it out. Or see it in action with our [demo documentation of the feature](https://bump.sh/bump/doc/petstore-alternatives#operation-post-pets-body-animal-cat-species-species-alternative)!
