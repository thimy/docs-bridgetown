#### Multi-file Deployment

Deploying multiple files on your Hub has never been this effortless. You can now provide a directory path to deploy all files within a directory to your Bump.sh hub.

For a more detailed walkthrough on how this works, check out the feature in action in our [latest release notes](https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0).

#### Live Preview

Using the Live Preview feature  `bump preview --live my-definition-api.yml` now creates an immediate preview without waiting for the first change on the target file.

#### Other improvements

- Keeping up with the latest version of the CLI is now easier thanks to a new warning in case of outdated version usage.
- Significant refactor of the deployment-related code to accommodate the new “Multiple files deploy” feature.
- CLI upgraded to TypeScript 4.5 and performed some dependency upgrades.
