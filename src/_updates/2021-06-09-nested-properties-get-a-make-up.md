Feedbacks are important to us and we do our best to make you feel heard.
We know that accessing nested properties is a pain point for many of you so we tried to make the navigation clearer and the selected element will now stand out more.

We'd love to hear from you and see if these changes suit your needs so hit us up with [your comments](mailto:hello@bump.sh) whether you love it or hate it!
