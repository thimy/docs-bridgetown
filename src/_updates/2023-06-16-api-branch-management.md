Branch Management is now available from the [Bump.sh API](https://developers.bump.sh/), making your API evolution workflows a whole lot smoother as an easy and effective way to manage your versions and optimizes how you deliver ephemeral or major ones, at hand (at least within our API).

### Let's explore how these new features simplify your API workflow

1. [Branch creation](https://developers.bump.sh/operation/operation-post-docs-parameter-branches): Create a new branch effortlessly with a single API call, eliminating manual work.
2. [List of Branches](https://developers.bump.sh/operation/operation-get-docs-parameter-branches): Obtain an overview of all API branches, facilitating efficient management and organization.
3. [Set Default Branch](https://developers.bump.sh/operation/operation-patch-docs-parameter-branches-parameter-set_default): Easily choose and showcase a default branch for up-to-date API documentation.
4. [Delete Branch](https://developers.bump.sh/operation/operation-delete-docs-parameter-branches-parameter): Remove unnecessary branches to maintain a clean and organized development environment.
