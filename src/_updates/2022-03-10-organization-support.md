Building the best APIs can be a considerable amount of work and you may need your teammates to help. But you definitely do not want one single shared account for that.

Freshly out of beta, the awaited **Organizations** feature helps you with that. We did not reinvent the wheel but wanted to make it as simple but powerful as possible.

You can easily customize access with 3 different roles: admin, maintainer, and viewers.
Admins can invite and manage access, maintainers can manage hubs and docs, guests are limited to read-only.

Available from the Startup plan, we hope it will help teams work efficiently and smoothly on their APIs. You can find out more about Organizations in our [Help Center](https://docs.bump.sh/help/organizations/)!

This update was also the opportunity to ship some enhancements for the dashboard.

We canâ€™t wait to hear about what you think of it so feel free to reach out!
