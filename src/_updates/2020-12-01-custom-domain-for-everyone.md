You can now [configure your custom domain](https://docs.bump.sh/help/custom-domains) directly from the app. No more manual email to us, just create your CNAME record, fill the form, and voil√†.

We also have good news for you: we've updated our pricing plans to allow you to set up custom domains on free plans. One would say it's Christmas, before Christmas. Enjoy!
