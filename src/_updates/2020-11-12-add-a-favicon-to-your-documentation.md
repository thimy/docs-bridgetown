title: Add a favicon to your documentation
tags: [Improvement]
---

Until now, for documentation having a customised logo, the same one was used as a favicon.

From now on, you can use a specific one, to brighten up your documentation more than ever!

Here is how [Bump's documentation](https://developers.bump.sh/) looks like now:

And icing on the cake: it works for your [hub](https://docs.bump.sh/help/hubs/) too!

Happy enhancement!
