[OpenAPI 3.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md) has been released today. Some important changes are coming with this new version. Above all, the greatest improvement is the support of `webhooks`, at the same first level than `paths`.

We are glad to announce today that webhooks are now supported by Bump, as you can see in this [live example](https://bump.sh/doc/webhook-example).

We hope you'll enjoy this new feature, don't hesitate to have a look to our [technical documentation](https://docs.bump.sh/help/specifications-support/openapi-support/webhooks/) if necessary.
