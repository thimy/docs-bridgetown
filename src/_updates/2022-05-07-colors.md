You already have deployed your API documentation but feel something's missing? You couldn't be more right.

Introducing one of the biggest updates to Bump yet: **UI Color customization**. You read that right. You can now change the primary color of your documentation to make it shine more than ever. Or make it match your logo/company brand!

We even added a short preview to help you find the best tone and ensure that you'll keep in mind how it will look in dark mode too.

Try it out from your _Dashboard > Customize UI_ and share with us your best results!
