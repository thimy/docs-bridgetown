Introducing **Branching**, a great way to host several versions of an API Specification on the same documentation.

If your API has several versions you would like to maintain or if you are working between two environments, branching will make a difference and limit the number of documentation in your hub.

Create as many branches as you need, upload files accordingly and find the versions of your API anytime in your documentation, through a small selection menu.

Define which branch should be chosen by default, add or delete branches, keep everything up-to-date and share with your ecosystem the best API experience possible.
