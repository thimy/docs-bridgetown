Organizations are great when you need to work collaboratively with your team. Instead of a single shared account, each member of your team will be able to access/maintain your documentation and hubs.

Organizations are also super useful if you want to invite guests (who are called "viewers") to your documentation: it's a read-only role. If you need to keep your API private or shared with a small number of partners, viewers are a great solution.

## Create a new organization

You can easily create an organization from your dashboard. Select the settings section and the organization tab. From here, you can create an organization or manage the ones you own.

Select "Create Organization" to start a new one. You'll need to name it and choose its slug.

## Member management

Once your organization is created, you may want to invite teammates and guests (which is the point, actually). When you invite a new member, you'll have to select a role before sending the invitation. Each role has its own permissions, detailed below. Roles can be modified at anytime.

| Role/Permission          | Admin | Maintainer | Viewer |
|:-------------------------|:------|:-----------|:-------|
| Documentation access     | ✓     | ✓          | ✓      |

Billing and invoice are only managed by the owner of the organization.

## Organization management

From your dashboard, you can manage the organizations you own and those you have admin role. Organization settings allow you to change its name and URL, transfer ownership to an active member or completely delete the organization.

:::caution
Transferring ownership is mandatory if you want to leave an organization. You can only transfer ownership to a member with admin role.
