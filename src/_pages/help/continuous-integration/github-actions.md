## Generate your API documentation & changelog

Bump is a Continuous Documentation Platform: it lets you keep your API doc always synchronized with your codebase. With this [Github Action](https://github.com/actions) you can automatically generate your API reference (with changelog and diff) on [Bump](https://bump.sh) from any [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) or [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi) file.

## Usage

Start by creating a documentation on [Bump](https://bump.sh/users/sign_up). Then add one of the following workflow file to your GitHub project.

:::info
In all the examples below, make sure to change the branch name _`main`_with the name of your repository main destination branch, replace _`<BUMP_DOC_ID>`_ with your Bump documentation slug or id and change the filepath_`doc/api-documentation.yml`_with your api specification file path.
:::

:::caution
[`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) has to be called **before our action**.
:::

### Deploy on `git push`

If you only need to deploy the documentation on push you can use this workflow file:

`.github/workflows/bump-deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy-doc:
    name: Deploy API doc on Bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy API documentation
        uses: bump-sh/github-action@v1
        with:
          doc: <BUMP_DOC_ID>
          token: ${{secrets.BUMP_TOKEN}}
          file: doc/api-documentation.yml
```

### API diff on pull requests

If you only want to have API diff summary sent as a comment on your pull requests:

`.github/workflows/bump-diff.yml`

```yaml
name: API diff

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  api-diff:
    name: Check API diff on Bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Comment pull request with API diff
        uses: bump-sh/github-action@v1
        with:
          doc: <BUMP_DOC_ID>
          token: ${{secrets.BUMP_TOKEN}}
          file: doc/api-documentation.yml
          command: diff
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

### API diff on pull requests & Deploy on push

This is the most common workflow that we [recommend](../../continuous-integration/#integrate-with-your-ci), which will create two steps in your automation flow: a validation & diff step on code reviews, followed by a deployment step on merged changes.

`.github/workflows/bump.yml`

```yaml
name: Check & deploy API documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  deploy-doc:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
    name: Deploy API documentation on Bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy API documentation
        uses: bump-sh/github-action@v1
        with:
          doc: <BUMP_DOC_ID>
          token: ${{secrets.BUMP_TOKEN}}
          file: doc/api-documentation.yml

  api-diff:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
    name: Check API diff on Bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Comment pull request with API diff
        uses: bump-sh/github-action@v1
        with:
          doc: <BUMP_DOC_ID>
          token: ${{secrets.BUMP_TOKEN}}
          file: doc/api-documentation.yml
          command: diff
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

:::info
Since [February 2nd, 2023](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-02-github-actions-updating-the-default-github_token-permissions-to-read-only/), the default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions are set to read-only
for every new repository.

Permissions have to be explicitly defined in your workflows, as illustrated above.

## Input parameters

- `doc` (required): Documentation slug (or id). Can be found in the documentation settings on [https://bump.sh/docs](https://bump.sh/docs)

  - Your Bump token can be found in the documentation settings on [https://bump.sh](https://bump.sh). Copy it for later usage.
  - In your GitHub repository, click Settings, and then Secrets.
  - Click the button “New repository secret”, name the secret `BUMP_TOKEN` and paste your Bump token in the value field.

- `file`: Relative path to the documentation file. _Default: __`api-contract.yml`__._
- `command`: Bump command to execute. _Default: __`deploy`_
  - `deploy` deploy a new version of the documentation
