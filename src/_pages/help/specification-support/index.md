Bump.sh supports the most popular specifications for REST APIs and Event-Driven APIs.

- [OpenAPI Specification](specifications-support/openapi-support)
- [AsyncAPI Specification](specifications-support/asyncapi-support)

We do plan to support more specifications in the future. If there is one specifically you're looking for, feel free to contact us!
