title: Name and sort endpoints and webhooks
---

In the Bump.sh console, if you click on any of your documentations and select **Customize UI** in the left menu, you can scroll down to **How to group operations?**. There are three options available:
- `(default)`
The default behaviour of Bump.sh is automatic grouping based on the presence of a list of top-level `tags`. More on that in [the `Group by tags` section](#group-by-tag).
- [`Group by tags`](#group-by-tag)
- [`Group by path`](#group-by-path)

But first let's provide a bit more context on endpoints and webhooks.

## Endpoints and Webhooks are resources

REST APIs are composed of a set of possible requests, from server to server.

- In the API context, endpoints are most of the time [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) that provides the location of a specific resource on an API server.
With OpenAPI, endpoints are stored under the resource `paths`.

OR

- Webhooks are requests that can be generated from the API to the external server, after a specific event occurred. Webhooks are stored with OpenAPI 3.1 under resource `webhooks`

Here's how we describe, sort and group these resources, based on an OpenAPI specification example. Below is an overview of the full specification you can find on [OpenAPI Specification examples repo.](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml)

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  title: Swagger Petstore
paths:
  /pets:
    get:
      summary: List all pets
      operationId: listPets
      tags:
        - all pets
      # ...

    post:
      summary: Create a pet
      operationId: createPets
      tags:
        - single pet
      # ...
  /pets/{petId}:
    get:
      summary: Info for a specific pet
      operationId: showPetById
      tags:
        - single pet
      # ...

```

There are three operations here, and three different ways to generate, group and order them, regarding option chosen for **How to group operations?**

### Group by tag

:::caution
Be careful about operations without tags when option `Group operations by tag` is selected, as they would be ignored!
:::

You may have noticed in the above API Contract that there are two different `tags`: `all pets` and `single pet`.
If you choose option `Group by tag`, Bump.sh will use these `tags` to group, name and sort the operations.

 Here is our [Petstore live example](https://bump.sh/hub/examples/doc/petstore-grouped-by-tags), based on the OpenAPI specification, with option `Group by tag` :

![Group Petstore operations by tag](/images/help/group-by-tags-dark.png)

:::info
If first level field `tags` are present at the [root of your OpenAPI document object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3#openapi-object), Bump.sh will use `Group by tags` as a default documentation generation behaviour.
:::

Having this first level field `tags` allows you to override how your `endpoints` are ordered. Take the following API Contract sample:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: single pet
    description: all operations related to managing a single pet
  - name: all pets
    description: all operations related to managing all pets
paths:
  # ...
```

With these first level tags, endpoints `Single Pet` would be displayed above `All pets` in the left menu of your documentation.

Note that you can also provide a `description` for your `tags`. This description will be displayed just under the `name` of the `tag` at the top level of your `tag` documentation page.

This option `Group by tag` allows a better customization of your doc, by overriding resources name.

### Group by path

In this case, we deduce endpoint name from related `path`. First part of the path is extracted to generate the `endpoint` name, and every operation related to this endpoint name will be grouped together.


Let's Bump it up to something visual with a [Petstore live example](https://bump.sh/hub/examples/doc/petstore):

![Group petstore operations by path](/images/help/group-by-path-dark.png)

Operations `GET` and `POST` from `/pets` , and `GET` from `/pets/{petId}` are grouped under same endpoint `Pets` (first part of the path), and their names are generated from field `summary`.

### Webhooks

And what about webhooks?

It's quite well explained how webhooks name are generated from `summary`, `description`  in [Webhooks documentation's page](/specifications-support/openapi-support/webhooks). But by choosing option `Group by tag`, `webhooks` are displayed, grouped and ordered with same rules as for `endpoints`.

:::caution
Be careful about webhooks without tags when option `Group by tag` is selected, as they would be ignored!
:::

Two possibilities for this OpenAPI 3.1 documentation with endpoints and webhooks, on our [examples hub](https://bump.sh/hub/examples):

- [Resources grouped by path](https://bump.sh/hub/examples/doc/webhooks-extended)
- [Resources grouped by tags](https://bump.sh/hub/examples/doc/webhooks-extended-grouped-by-tags)

Finally, we hope these options will help you build the most readable documentations, feel free to [contact us](mailto:hello@bump.sh) if you need support or have some suggestion.
